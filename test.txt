On a summer day so bright and fair,
With sunbeams dancing in the air,
I find delight in a simple treat,
A pickle crisp, so cool and sweet.

Amid the heat, it’s pure delight,
A tangy burst, so fresh and bright,
Its briny kiss, a welcome thrill,
A tiny joy, a bite to fill.

With every crunch, the world’s at ease,
A moment’s bliss beneath the trees,
The pickle’s magic, green and bold,
A story of summer, joy untold.

So here’s to pickles, crisp and fine,
A perfect match for sunny clime,
In every bite, a piece of cheer,
The taste of summer, bright and clear.
